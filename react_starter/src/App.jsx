/**
 * The Component Tree & Props
 *
 * App.jsx is the "root" or "parent" component of your application.
 * It holds the data (portfolioData) and passes it down to "child" components
 * (Header, About, etc.) via "props".
 *
 * Think of it like a waterfall: Data flows DOWN from parent to child.
 * In React, this is a one-way flow, but we can use some nifty techniques
 * like "lifting state up" and "callback" functions to send data back up if needed.

        CHALLENGE: Assemble Your Portfolio!

        Your goal is to replace the <StarterInstructions /> with your own components by the end of this workshop. Once completed, your portfolio should render your personal information, skills, and projects dynamically based on the data provided in `portfolioData.js`. 

        Follow these steps: 
        1. Uncomment the components one by one (Header, About, etc.).
        2. Notice how we pass data to them using props (e.g., personal={personal}). We may have to update these props based on what each component needs as we build them out.
        3. Check your browser to see your portfolio come to life!
        4. Comment out <StarterInstructions /> below once you have your portfolio rendering correctly.
        5. Deploy your portfolio and share it with the world!
        6. Profit???
